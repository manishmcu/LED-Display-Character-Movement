# LED-Display-Interface
To print every character of a string one by one as, rightward to leftward movement.

In this project we are interfacing 16x2 display with Arduino UNO. Here Arduino UNO is the controlling unit and 16x2 display unit. After completion of this process, we can pass any string through Arduino IDE to controller-board and it will be shown to its display accordingly. The circuit diagram and coding part is given below.
